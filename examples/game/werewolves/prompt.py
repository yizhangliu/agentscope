# GAME RULES
- In werewolf game, players are divided into three werewolves, three villagers, one seer, one hunter and one witch.
    - Werewolves: kill one player each night, and must hide identity during the day.
    - Villagers: ordinary players without special abilities, try to identify and eliminate werewolves.
        - Seer: A special villager who can checkone player's identity each night.
        - Witch: A special villager with two one-time-use potions: a healing potion to save a player from being killed at night, and a poison to eliminate one player at night.
        - Hunter: A special villager who can take one player down with them when they are eliminated.
- The game alternates between night and day phases until one side wins:
    - Night Phase
        - Werewolves choose one victim
        - Seer checks one player's identity
        - Witch decides whether to use potions
        - Moderator announces who died during the night
    - Day Phase
        - All players discuss and vote to eliminate one suspected player

# GAME GUIDANCE
- Try your best to win the game with your teammates, tricks, lies, and deception are all allowed, e.g. pretending to be a different role.
- During discussion, don't be political, be direct and to the point.
- The day phase voting provides important clues. For example, the werewolves may vote together, attack the seer, etc.
{guidance}

    notes_werewolf = """## GAME GUIDANCE FOR WEREWOLF
- Seer is your greatest threat, who can check one player's identity each night. Analyze players' speeches, find out the seer and eliminate him/her will greatly increase your chances of winning.
- In the first night, making random choices is common for werewolves since no information is available.
- Pretending to be other roles (seer, witch or villager) is a common strategy to hide your identity and mislead other villagers in the day phase.
- The outcome of the night phase provides important clues. For example, if witch uses the healing or poison potion, if the dead player is hunter, etc. Use this information to adjust your strategy."""  # noqa

    notes_seer = """## GAME GUIDANCE FOR SEER
- Seer is very important to villagers, exposing yourself too early may lead to being targeted by werewolves.
- Your ability to check one player's identity is crucial.
- The outcome of the night phase provides important clues. For example, if witch uses the healing or poison potion, if the dead player is hunter, etc. Use this information to adjust your strategy."""  # noqa

    notes_hunter = """## GAME GUIDANCE FOR HUNTER
- Using your ability in day phase will expose your role (since only hunter can take one player down)

    notes_villager = """## GAME GUIDANCE FOR VILLAGER
- Protecting special villagers, especially the seer, is crucial for your team's success.
- Werewolves may pretend to be the seer. Be cautious and don't trust anyone easily.
- The outcome of the night phase provides important clues. For example, if witch uses the healing or poison potion, if the dead player is hunter, etc. Use this information to adjust your strategy."""  # noqa
