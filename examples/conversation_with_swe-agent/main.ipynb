    "# Conversation with Software Engineering Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "SWE-agent(SoftWare Engineering Agent) is an agent designed for solving real world software engineering problems, such as fixing github issues.\n",
    "More details can be found in the project's [homepage](https://swe-agent.com/) and related [github repo](https://swe-agent.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example here, we partially implement the SWE-agent, and provide a simple example of how to use the implemented SWE-agent to fix a bug in a python file.\n",
    "You should note that currently how to enable agents with stronger programming capabilities remains an open challenge, and the performance of the partially implemented SWE-agent is not guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow [README.md](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope) to install AgentScope. We require the latest version, so you should build from source by running `pip install -e .` instead of installing from pypi. \n",
    "- Prepare a model configuration. AgentScope supports both local deployed model services (CPU or GPU) and third-party services. More details and example model configurations please refer to our [tutorial](https://doc.agentscope.io/build_tutorial/model.html).\n",
    "- Understand the ServiceToolkit module and how to use it to pre-process the tool functions for LLMs. You can refer to the [ReAct agent example](../conversation_with_react_agent/main.ipynb) and you should also refer to the [tutorial](https://doc.agentscope.io/build_tutorial/tool.html) for service functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- The example is tested with the following models. For other models, you may need to adjust the prompt.\n",
    "    - gpt-4\n",
    "    - dashscope_chat (qwen-max)\n",
    "    - gemini_chat (gemini-pro)\n",
    "    - ollama_chat (llama3_8b)\n",
    "- How to enable agents with stronger programming capabilities remains an open challenge, and the current implementations are not perfect. Please feel free to explore it yourself."
