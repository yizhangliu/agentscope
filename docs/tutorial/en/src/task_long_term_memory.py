Long-Term Memory
========================

In AgentScope, we provide a basic class for long-term memory (``LongTermMemoryBase``) and an implementation based on the `mem0 <https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0>`_ library (``Mem0LongTermMemory``).
Together with the design of ``ReActAgent`` class in :ref:`agent` section, we provide two long-term memory modes:

- ``agent_control``: the agent autonomously manages long-term memory by tool calls, and
- ``static_control``: the developer explicitly controls long-term memory operations.

Developers can also use the ``both`` mode, which activates both memory management modes.

.. hint:: These memory modes are suitable for different usage scenarios. Developers can choose the appropriate mode based on their needs.

Using mem0 Long-Term Memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: We provide an example of using mem0 long-term memory in the GitHub repository under the ``examples/long_term_memory/mem0`` directory.

# %%
# The ``Mem0LongTermMemory`` class provides two main methods for long-term memory operations:
# ``record`` and ``retrieve``.
# They take a list of messages as input and record/retrieve information from long-term memory.
#
# As an example, we first store a user preference and then retrieve related information from long-term memory.

# Integration with ReAct Agent
# ----------------------------------------
# In AgentScope, the ``ReActAgent`` class receives a ``long_term_memory``
# parameter in its constructor, as well as a ``long_term_memory_mode`` parameter
# that specifies the long-term memory mode.
#
# If ``long_term_memory_mode`` is set to ``agent_control`` or ``both``, two
# tool functions ``record_to_memory`` and ``retrieve_from_memory`` will be
# registered in the agent's toolkit, allowing the agent to autonomously
# manage long-term memory through tool calls.
#
# .. note:: To achieve the best results, the ``"agent_control"`` mode may require
#  additional instructions in the system prompt.
#
