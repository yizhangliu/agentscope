Agent
=========================

In this tutorial, we first focus on introducing the ReAct agent in AgentScope,
then we briefly introduce how to customize your own agent from scratch.

ReAct Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In AgentScope, the ``ReActAgent`` class integrates various features into a final implementation, including

Due to limited space, in this tutorial we only demonstrate the first three
features of ``ReActAgent`` class, leaving the others to the corresponding sections
listed above.

# %%
# Realtime Steering
# ---------------------------------------
#
# The realtime steering allows user to interrupt the agent's reply at any time,
# which is implemented based on the asyncio cancellation mechanism.
#
# Specifically, when calling the ``interrupt`` method of the agent, it will
# cancel the current reply task, and execute the ``handle_interrupt`` method
# for postprocessing.
#
# .. hint:: With the feature of supporting streaming tool results in
#  :ref:`tool`, users can interrupt the tool execution if it takes too long or
#  deviates from user expectations by Ctrl+C in the terminal or calling the
#  ``interrupt`` method of the agent in your code.
#
# The interruption logic has been implemented in the ``AgentBase`` class as a
# basic feature, leaving a ``handle_interrupt`` method for users to customize the
# post-processing of interruption as follows:
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#     # code snippet of AgentBase
#     class AgentBase:
#         ...
#         async def __call__(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Msg:
#             ...
#             reply_msg: Msg | None = None
#             try:
#                 self._reply_task = asyncio.current_task()
#                 reply_msg = await self.reply(*args, **kwargs)
#
#             except asyncio.CancelledError:
#                 # Catch the interruption and handle it by the handle_interrupt method
#                 reply_msg = await self.handle_interrupt(*args, **kwargs)
#
#             ...
#
#         @abstractmethod
#         async def handle_interrupt(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Msg:
#             pass
#
#
# In ``ReActAgent`` class, we return a fixed message "I noticed that you have
# interrupted me. What can I do for you?" as follows:
#
# .. figure:: ../../_static/images/interruption_en.gif
#     :width: 100%
#     :align: center
#     :class: bordered-image
#     :alt: Example of interruption
#
#     Example of interruption
#
# You can override it with your own implementation, for example, calling the LLM
# to generate a simple response to the interruption.
#
#
# Parallel Tool Calls
# ----------------------------------------
# ``ReActAgent`` supports parallel tool calls by providing a ``parallel_tool_calls``
# argument in its constructor.
# When multiple tool calls are generated, and ``parallel_tool_calls`` is set to ``True``,
# they will be executed in parallel by the ``asyncio.gather`` function.
#


# prepare a tool function
def example_tool_function(tag: str) -> ToolResponse:
    """A sample example tool function"""
    start_time = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S.%f")

    # Sleep for 3 seconds to simulate a long-running task
    time.sleep(3)

    end_time = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S.%f")
    return ToolResponse(
        content=[
            TextBlock(
                type="text",
                text=f"Tag {tag} started at {start_time} and ended at {end_time}. ",
            ),
        ],
    )


toolkit = Toolkit()
toolkit.register_tool_function(example_tool_function)

# Create an ReAct agent
agent = ReActAgent(
    name="Jarvis",
    sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Jarvis.",
    model=DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",

async def example_parallel_tool_calls() -> None:
    """Example of parallel tool calls"""
    # prompt the agent to generate two tool calls at once
    await agent(
        Msg(
            "user",
            "Generate two tool calls of the 'example_tool_function' function with tag as 'tag1' and 'tag2' AT ONCE so that they can execute in parallel.",
            "user",
        ),
    )


asyncio.run(example_parallel_tool_calls())

# %%
# Structured Output
# ----------------------------------------
# To generate a structured output, the ``ReActAgent`` instance receives a child class
# of the ``pydantic.BaseModel`` as the ``structured_model`` argument in its ``__call__`` function.
# Then we can get the structured output from the ``metadata`` field of the returned message.
#
#
# Taking introducing Einstein as an example:
#

# Create an ReAct agent
agent = ReActAgent(
    name="Jarvis",
    sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Jarvis.",
    model=DashScopeChatModel(
        model_name="qwen-max",
        api_key=os.environ["DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"],
        # Preset the generation kwargs to enable parallel tool calls
        generate_kwargs={
            "parallel_tool_calls": True,
        },
    ),
    memory=InMemoryMemory(),
    formatter=DashScopeChatFormatter(),
    toolkit=Toolkit(),
    parallel_tool_calls=True,
)


# The structured model
class Model(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="The name of the person")
    description: str = Field(
        description="A one-sentence description of the person",
    )
    age: int = Field(description="The age")
    honor: list[str] = Field(description="A list of honors of the person")


async def example_structured_output() -> None:
    """The example structured output"""
    res = await agent(
        Msg(
            "user",
            "Introduce Einstein",
            "user",
        ),
        structured_model=Model,
    )
    print("\nThe structured output:")
    print(json.dumps(res.metadata, indent=4))


asyncio.run(example_structured_output())

# %%
# Customizing Agent
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# AgentScope provides two base classes, ``AgentBase`` and ``ReActAgentBase``, which
# differ in the abstract methods they define and the hooks they support.
# Specifically, the ``ReActAgentBase`` extends ``AgentBase`` with additional ``_reasoning`` and ``_acting``
# abstract methods, as well as their pre- and post- hooks.
#
# Developers can choose to inherit from either of these base classes based on their needs.
# We summarize the agent under ``agentscope.agent`` module as follows:
#
# .. list-table:: Agent classes in AgentScope
#     :header-rows: 1
#
#     * - Class
#       - Abstract Method
#       - Support Hooks
#       - Description

#       - | ``reply``
#         | ``observe``
#         | ``print``
#         | ``handle_interrupt``
#       - | pre\_/post_reply
#         | pre\_/post_observe
#         | pre\_/post_print
#       - The base class for all agents, providing the basic interface and hooks.
#     * - ``ReActAgentBase``
#       - | ``reply``
#         | ``observe``
#         | ``print``
#         | ``handle_interrupt``
#         | ``_reasoning``
#         | ``_acting``
#       - | pre\_/post_reply
#         | pre\_/post_observe
#         | pre\_/post_print
#         | pre\_/post_reasoning
#         | pre\_/post_acting
#       - The abstract class for ReAct agent, extending ``AgentBase`` with reasoning and acting abstract methods and their hooks.
#     * - ``ReActAgent``
#       - \-
#       - | pre\_/post_reply
#         | pre\_/post_observe
#         | pre\_/post_print
#         | pre\_/post_reasoning
#         | pre\_/post_acting
#       - An implementation of ``ReActAgentBase``
#     * - ``UserAgent``
#       -
#       -
#       - A special agent that represents the user, used to interact with the agent
